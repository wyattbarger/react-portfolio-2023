# React Portfolio 2023

[This Stack Overflow resource was provided during the meeting reviewing React to help me reference images in a way that prevents errors in pathing.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39999367/how-do-i-reference-a-local-image-in-react)

[This is a codepen project I like to use to figure out what filter property I can apply to an image in css to get the color to change in my development environment. This way I can pull in various sizes of the image assets I want to use early in the project and then recolor them as needed in the code base.](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp)

[This is the website for flowbite, as opposed to listing the source for each section of the documentation used. This is used as an alternative to Tailwinds that offers more feature than the free version, with clear documentation on how to implement the technology into your React app. This technology was pointed out to me by Andres Jimenez when I mentioned that I planned on using Tailwind with this project. Link is to the quick start guide, but please note I will be using all of the documentation necessary for each part of component styling used.](https://www.flowbite-react.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart)

[NPM page for react-responsive which will be used to handle modile responsiveness within the project. Documentation present in this link will be referenced as needed.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive)

[This is the documentation I used to figure out how to establish a 'Router' component using react-router-dom to get my Header components NavBar to function properly. I also used the sub categories of this documentation as need for the router and the associated functionality.](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/picking-a-router)

[This was another source that I used to reference when working with the react-router-dom elements of my project.](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp)

[This is the section from the Flowbite react library documentation on their footer components, this was necessary as I had my own idea of how I wanted my footer to look so this documentation allowed me to find out the proper way to use these components along with tailwind CSS styling and div wrappers to acheive my desired design.](https://www.flowbite-react.com/docs/components/footer)

[This article was used as it gave me a way to implement a piece of advice given to me in my first review session with Andres Jimenez, about importing my images instead of pathing to them directly in my code. This article offers a shorthand way of importing and declaring something as a React component in one line. It also explains many of the reasons to do this, as Andres also did.](https://betterprogramming.pub/react-best-way-of-importing-svg-the-how-and-why-f7c968272dd9)

[Tailwind css documentation refering to justify items, used to get a refresh on how to style inline with className, this specific section of the documentation was useful whe syling the footer element.](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/justify-items)

[This is useful for the share button functionality I would like to add to make the url copy to the users clipboard so it can be shared by pasting it in a desired location.](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp)

[Another source like the one about used to help implement the code I needed to acheive the desired share button functionality.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-the-current-url-with-javascript/#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20this%20by,location.)

[I used this website to help get ideas for how to color and style my website.](https://coolors.co/000000-1b1d20-292b30-363940-444850-515660-80848c-989ba2-afb2b8-ffffff)

[This source was used for finding out the best way to use gradients with tailwind css, along with the tailwindcss documentation. No code was taken from this website.](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-adding-gradients-tailwind-css/)

[MDN docs on clip path that was also useful for trying to style my gradient on the about.jsx page that I was making.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)
