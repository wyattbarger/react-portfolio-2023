# React Portfolio 2023

[This Stack Overflow resource was provided during the meeting reviewing React to help me reference images in a way that prevents errors in pathing.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39999367/how-do-i-reference-a-local-image-in-react)

[This is a codepen project I like to use to figure out what filter property I can apply to an image in css to get the color to change in my development environment. This way I can pull in various sizes of the image assets I want to use early in the project and then recolor them as needed in the code base.](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp)

[This is the website for flowbite, as opposed to listing the source for each section of the documentation used. This is used as an alternative to Tailwinds that offers more feature than the free version, with clear documentation on how to implement the technology into your React app. This technology was pointed out to me by Andres Jimenez when I mentioned that I planned on using Tailwind with this project. Link is to the quick start guide, but please note I will be using all of the documentation necessary for each part of component styling used.](https://www.flowbite-react.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
